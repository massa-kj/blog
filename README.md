# my-tech-blog

A personal technical blog built with Astro and Tailwind CSS.  
I write about software engineering, programming (e.g., Rust, React ...), and my journey in open source.

## Live Site

ðŸ‘‰ [https://massa-kj.github.io/blog/](https://massa-kj.github.io/blog/)  

## Tech Stack & Selection Criteria

This blog was intentionally built using cutting-edge front-end tools and techniques that I don't use in my work, but that I wanted to explore in depth.
The selection was based on the following criteria:

- **Learning opportunity** â€“ Tools that offer a lot to learn at a systems or architectural level
- **Future potential** â€“ Technologies with active ecosystems and long-term community support
- **Not used in past work** â€“ To deliberately step outside my current stack and comfort zone
- **Flexible for future replacement** â€“ The site structure and content are decoupled enough to allow migration or refactoring if needed

### Core Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Static Site Generator
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - For post writing
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting
